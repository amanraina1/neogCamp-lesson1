   <h1>Aman's Component Library</h1>
   <p>
    <b>Hi! I am Aman</b> and i'm attending neogCamp and is
     currently completing levelZero one weekend and assignment at a time.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a component library created by me to better design each element.
    <br>
    <br>
    After completing this library i am going to use the components in my 
    <b>portfolio, blog and all projects</b> 
    created. This will ensure all my projects have 
    <b>consistent themeing and styling.</b>

   <h1>The biggest heading h1</h1>

   <p>This is normal text. Long running text would look like this on the website.
    This will autofold based on the width.
   </p>
   <small>This is relatively smaller text</small>
